What is Gyro?
-------------

Gyro is a command-line tool for automating creating, updating, and maintaining cloud infrastructure. Gyro makes
infrastructure-as-code possible.

Using Gyro allows you to model your infrastructure using the Gyro language and then create, update, and
maintain that infrastructure using the ``gyro`` command-line tool.

The Gyro language is a DSL (domain specific language) for defining cloud infrastructure in a human-readable format. It
was built with readability and organizational flexbility in mind. The language provides the ability to concisely define
cloud infrastructure resources along with language constructs such a ``for`` loops, ``if`` conditionals, and
``virtual-resource`` definitions for packaging resources up into reusable components.
