Using a Command
---------------

A command uses the ``gyro <command-name> <arg1> <arg2>`` notation. The command can take as many arguments as defined by the implementation.

For example:

.. code-block:: java

	gyro help up

This command allows you to see the help file of a command. **help** is the name of the command being executed. The argument **up** is what the help will display about.
