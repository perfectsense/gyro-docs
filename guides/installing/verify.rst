Verify Installation
+++++++++++++++++++

Check that Gyro is installed and working by creating a small test configuration and running Gyro in test mode.

Start by creating a gyro directory in your project folder and an initial configuration file named ``init.gyro``, which gets created by running the following command:

 ``gyro init gyro:gyro-aws-provider:0.15-SNAPSHOT``

This will create a .gyro directory with an ``init.gyro`` file and will install all the plugins that are required to spin up a resource.

.. code::

    @repository: 'https://artifactory.psdops.com/public'
    @repository: 'https://artifactory.psdops.com/gyro-snapshots'
    @plugin: 'gyro:gyro-aws-provider:0.15-SNAPSHOT'

We will be creating a VPC resource to test our installation.

Create a file named `test.gyro` in the `gyro` directory, with the following configs

.. code::

    aws::vpc vpc
      cidr-block: "10.0.1.0/16"
    end

To verify the installation run ``gyro up <file>`` in test mode. If ``y`` is given at the prompt, gyro will generate a state file in the local directory ``.gyro/state/``, you can check your state file here ``.gyro/state/test.gyro``.

.. code:: shell

    $ /usr/local/bin/gyro up --test test.gyro
